<h2 class="sans">CHARIVARIA.</h2>

<p>Two sailors charged with stealing
a barrel of beer from a public-house
at Dover explained that it was only
a joke. The prosecution however
pointed out that when the defendants
were arrested a large part of the joke
was found to be on them.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>An applicant to the London Appeal
Tribunal asked for exemption on the
ground that he was engaged in the
business, previously monopolized by
Germans, of filling Santa Claus stockings.
The Tribunal however concluded
that for the present he would be better
employed in the business, also largely
a German monopoly before the War,
of filling a tunic.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Herr <span class="sc">Bethmann-Hollweg</span> has explained
to members of the German
<i>Flottenvereins</i> that after the War Germany
will require a strong Fleet to
"guard the transatlantic lanes of commerce."
This of course explains why
they have refrained up to the present
from annihilating the British Fleet.
They expect to use it in their coming
war with Portugal.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"The pair of swans on the lake at
Hampton Court," says a news item,
"have hatched out seven young cygnets."
Ordinary swans of course only
hatch out goslings or ducklets.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A defendant who was fined £1 at
Woking for shooting a wild-duck
pleaded that he was an enthusiastic
ornithologist and wanted the bird for
comparison with other specimens. We
ourselves in former times were in the
habit of mounting our wild ducks in
sets, but since the outbreak of the War
the exorbitant prices charged by the
local taxidermist have deprived us of
the pleasures of comparative ornithology.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A Bill introduced into the House of
Commons last week enables the Crown
to continue for a limited time after the
War (three years, with a possible extension
to another four) in possession
of land occupied during the War for
defence purposes. We understand that
in the framing of this measure the
feelings of <span class="sc">Tino</span> were not consulted.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The <i>Berlingske Tidende</i> declares that
the British authorities are collecting
vast quantities of coffee in Sweden
which will be sent to Germany after
the War. It is also generally believed,
on the strength of the reports of the
Paris Conference, that equally large
quantities of beans are being assembled
in France and elsewhere which will
be handed to Germany immediately
after the conclusion of the struggle.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A Willesden man, charged with being
disorderly at a music-hall, pleaded that
the performance was so jolly that
he had to dance. That sort of thing
is all right in places like Willesden, but
we trust that our West End managers
will continue to eliminate from their
programmes anything likely to be provocative
of similar behaviour.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The report that Mexico has sent an
ultimatum to the United States is
probably exaggerated. The Mexican
authorities are said to be of the opinion
that a policy of firmness combined with
moderation will bring their unruly
neighbour to reason.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A turtle weighing a ton has been
caught off the Scilly Isles. The animal,
which made no attempt to resist capture,
stated that it was tired of being
mistaken for a submarine.</p>

<h2 class="sans">WHAT THE PRESSMEN SAW.</h2>

<h4>(<span class="sc">By our Naval Expert</span>).</h4>

<p>I have passed a week rich in experiences. The things
I've seen! As one of a party of journalists accorded the
privilege of a visit to the Trawler Fleet I am able to-day
at last to lift the curtain and tell the public what is going
on. It is true that there are some restrictions as to what
may be published, but I think you will find that I am free
to relate the best bits.</p>

<p>The Trawler Fleet! The Trawler Fleet is a power of
great and diverse capabilities. But my visit was paid not
so much to estimate its fighting value as to plumb its
spiritual depths (which are not so likely to be interfered
with by the Censor). The very heart of British sea power,
the epitome of modern naval war, is to be found in a little
port somewhere on the &mdash;&mdash; Coast. Here cluster just
ordinary little one-funnelled trawlers, grimy little every-day
vessels. These are the real thing. They come and go,
these trawlers, in and out, back and forth, up and down,
round and round; but they are being wrought into the
weft and woof of history, every one of them.</p>

<p>I contemplated them. On one I found an old tar cleaning
his shore-going boots. We entered into conversation, the
ice being broken by a friendly query of his as to whether
the adoption of Summer Time had affected the prohibited
hours. And I&mdash;with intention&mdash;asked him if he had been
fishing.</p>

<p>"Fishing?" said he; and he looked at me and winked.
There was heroism in his wink with a dash of humour, as
is the way with men of our race.</p>

<p>On another I found a mere boy. His job, I gathered,
was to help the cook and wash up. "The War," he
considered, "'adn't made no sort o' difference to 'im. His
job went on much the same."</p>

<p>Well, I took off my hat to him&mdash;I couldn't resist it.
Never have I been more thrilled at the thought of the
indomitable spirit of our race. No difference!</p>

<p>I questioned him further, but he evinced all the
admirable and impenetrable reticence of the Service in
war-time.</p>

<p>Deeply moved by these experiences I next accosted a
brawny stoker covered with the grime of his calling. "The
life seems to suit you all right," I cried, and slapped him on
the back. The result was noteworthy. He made absolutely
no reply of any sort but spat over the side.</p>

<p>And finally I must tell the story of the trawler and the
mine. We all heard it, and most of the best people are
telling it. It reveals better than anything perhaps the
spiritual depths. It was related by an officer who had
taken charge of our party and who actually showed us
a photograph of the mine in question in a little museum of
relics he had established on the quay, which contained
also a part of a chronometer, said to be German, and a loaf
of potato bread, captured and brought home under conditions
that will make a stirring story after the War. The
mine had been towed in by a fisherman who had flung a
rope round its horns. "Cool hand, that fisherman," the
narrator concluded. (It is only fair to say that in some
versions given to the public the expression is set down
as "Offhand chap" or "Careless old card," but I believe
these to be incorrect.) "He said it must be safe enough
for he had towed it for fourteen miles." (There has been
some little discrepancy as to the mileage also, one sensational
writer in the Yellow Press even putting it as high
as nineteen.)</p>

<p>A wonderful week! It is folly to draw great conclusions
from a hasty visit. All the same this is my considered
message to the British Public&mdash;<i>Trust the Trawlers.</i></p>

<h3>HIS LADY FRIEND.</h3>

<p>When the post came in Private
Grimes was sitting alone, hammering
a strip of metal with a stone. During
the eight months that this solitary
and silent man had been in Flanders
he had not received so much as a
picture-postcard, and he expected
nothing now. But to the surprise
not only of himself but of all the
men who saw it, this post brought
him a letter:&mdash;</p>

<p class="block">
"<span class="sc">Deer Henery</span> she is in the best off
helth i thort you mite be wunderin'
the wether heer is shokin' As it leeves
me at presant <span class="sc">Bill</span>."
</p>

<p>Grimes read it with obvious satisfaction
and put it in his pocket; soon
he took it out and read it again.</p>

<p>In the group round the fire that
night Grimes was again working on
his piece of metal.</p>

<p>"'Eard from 'is girl at last," said
Private Brant to the others, indicating
Grimes by a jerk of the head. "'Dear
'Arold, when are you goin' to send me
the bewtiful ring you're makin'?' she
says."</p>

<p>"Ring, is it?" said Parker. "Looks
as if it would be more like a kid's 'oop,
when it's finished. She must 'ave a
finger like two thumbs. Grimes, old
son, you can take it from me she won't
give you a blanky thank-you for it.
Lummy, look at the jools!"&mdash;and in
the firelight they saw the glint of red
and blue against the polished strip of
metal.</p>

<p>"Is she young and fair, Grimes?"
asked a humourist.</p>

<p>"If she was 'ere she'd teach you
manners," said Private Grimes.</p>

<p>The jewels were pieces of glass from
a shattered church-window. Grimes
was pleased with them, and even
whistled a note or two as he worked.
"Won't give me a thank-you, eh?" he
thought, with a bit of a smile.</p>

<p>Three weeks later he went home on
leave. She was not at Victoria (whoever
she was). His visit would be a
surprise for her. He got off the tram
at Vauxhall and turned into the
narrow side-streets.</p>

<p>From the yard of a brewery in the
distance a van was emerging. A big
red-faced man was on the dickey, and
on a barrel beside him was something
white. Grimes whistled; and the
white patch leapt into vigorous life,
giving out glad barks and little impatient
whines. "Wot cher, Grimey!"
called the driver, as he pulled up to
lower the wriggling patch of white to
the road; and Bess, an ecstatic bull-terrier,
with the gladdest of pink-rimmed
eyes, came bounding towards
the soldier.</p>

<p>He caught her up and took a good
look at her. She licked his unwashed
unshaven face.</p>

<p>"Looks all right, don't she, Grimey?"
asked the other a little anxiously.
"Never 'ad a thing to eat but wot you
said, all the time."</p>

<p>"Looks a treat, Bill," said Bess's
master; and Bill knew that this was
high-praise.</p>

<p>"'Ere, Bess, 'ere's a sooveneer,"
said Grimes. He put her down and,
taking her paw in his hand, bent
and fastened into place that strip of
waste war-metal, ornamented with bits
of saints from an old church window
in Flanders.</p>

<p>For a woman who has barely scraped
through a charge of poisoning her husband
and has had to change her name
and dye her hair from yellow to sable
(contrary to the customary order of
things) and lead "the wolf's life"&mdash;preying,
that is, on innocent
lambs&mdash;there might
be worse hells on earth
than the Sleeve Ard
Hotel, Ardcastle, Co. Down,
with its pleasant lake and
mountain scenery, its golf
and its real Irish waiter.
And it was a cruel stroke
of bad luck that into this
quiet fold, teeming with
woolly lambs of all ages
in their crisp fleeces of
fivers and tenners, there
should have intruded (1)
a vulgar blackmailer who
knew all about her lurid
past, and (2) a K.C. with
a deadly memory for the
details of <i>causes célèbres</i>.
And (3) it was a heart-breaking
coincidence that
the youngest lamb of all
should have borne such
a striking resemblance to the lady-wolf's
dead lover that she wanted
to embrace him instead of fleecing
him; and (4) that his betrothed
should have been the god-daughter
of the K.C. with the terrible recording
tablets.</p>

<p>But what would you? We are not
talking of life, but of a stage-play; and
from the moment of the curtain's rise,
when Miss Elsom sat down at the piano
and sang, without any provocation, a
little thing by Mr. <span class="sc">Landon Ronald</span>,
for the sole benefit of the Irish waiter,
to the juncture when the K.C. and the
blackmailer got through a game of
billiards in about four minutes, we were
seldom allowed to forget that we were
seeing things in a light
that never was on any
land but stageland.</p>

<p>Like so many theatrical
plays it was written up to
what the profession calls
a "strong scene." Even
the weather was pressed
into a shameless collusion;
for it was a wet afternoon
that gave the K.C. his
opportunity, as it might
have been in the house on
the road to Fiesole, of narrating,
with lavish detail
and the whole hotel for
audience, the story of the
murder trial in which
"<i>Mrs. Lytton</i>" (the wolf)
had figured as the prisoner;
and frankly indicating that,
if he had been the prosecutor,
he could have established
her guilt. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page423" id="page423"></a>[pg 423]</span>
object, more moral than humane, and
more histrionic than either, was to
confound the wretched woman, to expose
her identity and so, by a sudden
disillusionment, to restore her lamb to
the fold. The end, as it turned out for
the general good, did actually seem to
justify the means; but at the time it
was not a very edifying exhibition.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"One likes to show the truth for the truth;</p>
<p class="i2">That the woman was light is very true;</p>
<p>But suppose she says, Never mind that youth!</p>
<p class="i2">What wrong have I done to you?"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>"Well, anyhow" (as <span class="sc">Browning</span> also
said) it was an effective piece of stage-work,
and the result tallied with the
best conventions by which youth is reclaimed
from the snares of a baffled and
repentant vampire.</p>

<p>The staginess of things infected or
seemed to infect even Miss <span class="sc">Irene
Vanbrugh</span>. In the first Act I found
her a little spasmodic. And all through
the play the authors were most arbitrary
about the way in which they
made her meet the various attacks that
were sprung upon her. Thus, at a
small shock, she would suddenly start
and drop something; but when you expected
her at least to swoon on finding
that her true name had been discovered,
she bore the blow with superb aplomb.
And after enduring the K.C.'s interminable
recitation with only here and
there a sign of personal interest, she
finally gave herself away in a loud and
voluble protest against the idea that
any woman purposing to administer
poison to her husband could have been
callous enough to try it first on a
favourite dog.</p>

<p>There was inconsistency too in the
pace at which the performance was
conducted. All obvious things were
taken quite leisurely; but the speed at
which really difficult and complex details
were rushed, was simply torrential.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="sc">Irene Vanbrugh</span> had her own
reputation to compete with in the kind
of part in which we know her so well,
and to say that she was equal to it is
praise enough. She was best, perhaps,
because most womanly and least
wolfish, in the scene of her confession.
As for Mr. <span class="sc">Dion Boucicault</span> I would
not go so far as to say that his manner
deceived me into supposing that he was
a real K.C. I have mixed with many
real K.C.'s on the parade-ground or in
the trenches (home defence), but even
in the disguise of a uniform, and under
conditions that might tend to obscure
the outward signs of legal distinction,
I have always observed a certain manner
which betrayed their high calling.
That manner was not very saliently
marked in Mr. <span class="sc">Dion Boucicault</span>. But
he had an exceptional chance as an
actor and grasped it firmly.</p>

<p>The part of <i>Mr. Rigg</i>, blackmailer,
the mystery of whose personality,
aggravated by a <i>penchant</i> for "hovering"
with intent, constituted a darker
"Riddle" than that of "<i>Mrs. Lytton</i>,"
was played by Mr. <span class="sc">Oswald Marshall</span>
with admirable ease and reserve; and
Mr. <span class="sc">Stanley Drewitt's</span> <i>Professor Beveridge</i>,
an antique lamb who confided
to the wolf his views on "discontinuous
variations," and by way of reprisal was
touched by her for a couple of ten-pound
notes, had a pleasant air of
naïve sincerity. The others were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page424" id="page424"></a>[pg 424]</span>
sufficiently sound on the old accepted
lines.</p>

<p>The dialogue had too many long sentences
for spontaneity, and when I say
that the humour was largely confined
to the vague inconsequences of the
mother-in-law-to-be you will kindly
understand that it was neither profuse
nor sparkling.</p>

<p>I shall not venture to predict the
length of <i>The Riddle's</i> run; but I
suspect that the public may rise superior
to the judgment of the critics.
Plays that are purely actors' plays have
a habit, however familiar their formulas,
of coming home to the British bosom;
and this one may stick there. O. S.</p>

those who are promoting, under the
presidency of the Duchess of <span class="sc">Somerset</span>,
"The Women's Tribute to the
Soldiers and Sailors of the Empire."
The scheme offers an opportunity to
every woman to prove her gratitude to

and our liberty, and to assist in raising
a fund which will not compete with,
but be supplementary to, the recognised
agencies for the care of our sailors and
soldiers, particularly those who have
been wholly or partially disabled on
active service; bearing, in fact, the same
relation to those agencies that King
Edward's Hospital Fund bears to established
institutions for the relief of
sufferers by disease or accident.</p>

<p>The first three days of the Covent
Garden Week will be devoted to a

<p><i>Tuesday, June 20th.</i>&mdash;Once again the
House of Lords has forestalled the
Commons by its elastic procedure.
During the brief recess the Empire has
been stirred to its depths by the tragic
death of Lord <span class="sc">Kitchener</span>. Almost his
last official act was to meet his critics
of the House of Commons face to face,
reply to their questions, and leave them
silenced and admiring. Yet to-day the
Commons could do no more than listen
to the sympathetic messages from
foreign Parliaments read out to them
by the <span class="sc">Speaker</span>, and learn from the
<span class="sc">Prime Minister</span> that to-morrow he
would endeavour to give expression to
their feelings upon this "irreparable
loss." The Lords, less fettered by formality,
were able at once to pay their
tribute to the great dead and to hear
his praises sounded by a Statesman, a
Soldier and a Friend.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">Speaker</span> is no <span class="sc">Alexander</span> seeking
fresh worlds to conquer. Invited
to rebuke an Irish Member for wearing
a Sinn Fein badge he flatly declined,
with the remark that he had
nothing to do with the clothes Members
chose to wear. In refusing to set
up as an <i>arbiter elegantiarum</i> I think
Mr. <span class="sc">Lowther</span> is wise, for the post in
these days would be no sinecure. Time
was when the House was the best-dressed
assembly in the world. When
the late Mr. <span class="sc">Keir Hardie</span> entered its
precincts with a little cloth cap perched
upon his luxuriant curls he created
quite a shock. To-day no one, except
perhaps the Editor of <i>The Tailor and
Cutter</i>, would mind much if Mr.
<span class="sc">Snowden</span> were to appear in a fez or
Mr. <span class="sc">Ponsonby</span> in a <i>pickelhaube</i>.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, June 21st.</i>&mdash;What struck
me most in the <span class="sc">Prime Minister's</span> tribute
to Lord <span class="sc">Kitchener</span> was his evident
sense of personal loss in parting from one
with whom he had been in daily association
for two strenuous years. So
with the other speeches delivered. Each
was touched with genuine emotion and
illustrated some one or other of Lord
<span class="sc">Kitchener's</span> outstanding qualities,
Mr. <span class="sc">Bonar Law</span> spoke of the
sure instinct which caused him to realise
at the very outset the gigantic
nature of the present War; Mr. <span class="sc">Wardle</span>
of the absolute straightness which won
for him the confidence of the working-classes
Sir <span class="sc">Ivor Herbert</span>, a personal
friend who had occasionally differed
with him, of the unflinching courage
with which he faced alike Dervishes in
the desert or critics in Parliament; and
Sir <span class="sc">George Reid</span> of the equally conspicuous
humanity which he displayed
as an administrator in repairing the
ravages of War. Through all these
varied tributes rang the note of Duty
Well Done.</p>

<p>A singularly perverse fate obstructs
the efforts of the Government to tax
cocoa. As beer is notoriously the beverage
which supports the pens of Tory
leader-writers, so cocoa is supposed to
be the appropriate stimulus of Liberal
nibs. Until the War it got off remarkably
cheaply, as compared with its rival, tea,
being only taxed 1<i>d.</i> a pound. Mr.
<span class="sc">Lloyd George</span> dared add no more than
a halfpenny to the impost, but Mr.
<span class="sc">McKenna</span> with sublime courage proposed
to make the tax a round sixpence.</p>

<p>But this was before he knew as much
about cocoa as he does to-day. At sixpence
a pound, it seems, the imbiber of
cocoa would pay a fraction more to the
Exchequer for every cup that he consumed
than would the drinker of tea.
Such a dreadful anomaly in our otherwise
equitable fiscal system could not,
of course, be tolerated. So the tax has
now been fixed at 4-1/2<i>d.</i>, and Messrs.
<span class="sc">Cadbury</span> and <span class="sc">Rowntree</span> are grateful
and comforted.</p>

<p>Finding the <span class="sc">Chancellor of the
Exchequer</span> in this yielding mood, Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page427" id="page427"></a>[pg 427]</span>
<span class="sc">Lough</span> thought he would try to get rid
of the tax on sugar. But here Mr.
<span class="sc">McKenna</span> was obdurate. We used far
more sugar than any other European
nation, and must be forced to reduce
our consumption. Someone, remembering,
perhaps, how a month ago Mr.
<span class="sc">McKenna</span> had smiled approval while
his colleague, Mr. <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span>, defended
Prohibition against Tariffs as a
means of lessening consumption, suggested
that sugar-consumers should be
rationed instead of being taxed. But
Mr. <span class="sc">McKenna</span>, without turning a hair,
maintained that in war-time to raise
the price by taxation was the only way.
Political economy, once relegated by
Mr. <span class="sc">Gladstone</span> to Jupiter and Saturn,
is now, it seems, a permanent dweller

<p><i>Thursday, June 22nd.</i>&mdash;The House
of Lords welcomed a notable recruit in
the person of Lord <span class="sc">Chaplin</span>. To his
many remarkable performances in the
field and the forum the newcomer has
added another by gaining a step in the
peerage before taking his seat. Last
April it was announced that the <span class="sc">King</span>
had been pleased to confer upon him a
barony, but it was Viscount <span class="sc">Chaplin</span>,
of St. Oswald's, Blankney, who subscribed
the roll this afternoon.</p>

<p>Out of 173 questions on the Paper of
the House of Commons a large number
related to Ireland; but Ministers were
extremely economical of information.
The anticipated settlement still hangs
fire, and there are increasing fears that
it will not hold water. Almost the only
fact revealed was that Lord <span class="sc">Wimborne</span>
is no longer Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.
His resignation has been definitely
accepted. By Ireland, where he was
by no means an unwelcome <span class="sc">Guest</span>, he
will be more regretted than some other
Viceroys.</p>

<p>The extra income-tax on American
securities again led to some lively exchanges.
Sir <span class="sc">Frederick Banbury</span>
found himself in the unwonted company
of Mr. <span class="sc">D. M. Mason</span> in resisting
the Government proposals. These "Old
Tories" were told by Mr. <span class="sc">G. Faber</span>
that the world was upside down, and
that the sooner they realised it the
better. But even he thought the Government
were using up these dollar
securities rather fast. They ought to
treat them as "pearls of great price"
and not cast them away for American
bacon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">McKenna</span> was not at all in a
conciliatory mood, and startled some of
his opponents by reminding them that
under the Defence of the Realm Act
the Government could take any kind
of property at prices far below the
market value. When other men had
given up their lives for their country
why all this boggling over shares?&mdash;an
argument that the House as usual
found unanswerable.</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<blockquote><p>
"At Colmar a merchant has been sentenced
to a fine of £5 by a German court-martial
for repeating in a public restaurant the well-known
joke about ordering a sandwich at a
Prussian railway buffet, and being served with
a neat ticket between two bread tickets."</p>

<p><i>The Times.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Anyhow he deserved his punishment
for spoiling the only Teuton joke.</p>

<h3 class="sans">OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h3>

<h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks</i>)</h4>

<p>I am a little puzzled as to the authorship of <i>Action Front</i>
(<span class="sc">Smith</span>, <span class="sc">Elder</span>), which is stated to be written by <span class="sc">Boyd
Cable</span>, author of <i>Between the Lines</i>. First of all there was
a Mr. <span class="sc">Boyd Cable</span>, but he didn't last, for he soon turned
into "<span class="sc">Boyd Cable</span>" without the Mr., the inverted commas
indicating, I suppose, that this was a mere <i>nom de guerre</i>.
At or about the same time there was an author known as
"<span class="sc">Action Front</span>," whose writings were hardly to be distinguished
from those of "<span class="sc">Boyd Cable</span>." And now <i>Action
Front</i> becomes the title of a book by <span class="sc">Boyd Cable</span>. For
my own part I can only say that, whoever he may be,
<span class="sc">Boyd Cable</span>&mdash;let us try him without the inverts&mdash;has a
most remarkable gift for the writing of vivid and exciting
war-stories. He takes a phrase from the <i>communiqués</i> and
shows you with a seemingly careless art, of which he holds
the secret, what moving incidents, what heroism, what
self-sacrifice and glorious endurance are concealed behind
the bald official announcement.
Moreover, he has a
true appreciation of the
reckless and humorous
courage that characterises
the British fighting man,
the splendid human material
out of which great
events are fashioned. If
you add to these high
qualities a talent for making
you visualise the
scenes and the sequence
of incidents which he
describes you will obtain
some conception of the
methods of this most interesting
writer. He holds
you in his grip from the
moment he starts, and
there is no relaxation from
then to the finish. Each
little story is an admirable
piece of literary architecture.
If I had to class them I should place "Drill" and
"The Signallers" by themselves in the first division of the
first class. I will hint only one fault: it is too great a tax
on one's credulity to be asked to believe that a French
officer could have addressed an English private as <i>mon
beau Anglaise</i>. Otherwise I have nothing but praise for
<i>Action Front</i>, though I am still as far as ever from knowing
who wrote it.</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p>I feel I am beginning to know something of romantic
Russia and the Russians from the perpetual and jolly spate
of Mr. <span class="sc">Stephen Graham's</span> books. Through <i>Russian Central
Asia</i> (<span class="sc">Cassell</span>) is the very latest to hand. I like his easy
pace, his gentle universal friendliness, his fearlessness, his
untidy but interesting mind. He is a tramp of tramps.
With a thin wallet of notes and no weapon but a fountain-pen
he travels a couple of thousand miles or so and back,
faring on his own feet, steaming down stretches of navigable
river, taking the rail for a space, begging a lift in some prehistoric
conveyance, right from the Caspian, by magical
many-hued Bokhara and storied Samarkand that holds the
bones of <span class="sc">Tamerlane</span>, on through the flower-starred highlands
of the Seven Rivers Land to the Irtish river and
Siberian plains, sleeping under the stars or in a Khirgiz
tent of felt, or a riverside cave&mdash;surely a happy careless man.
And he has made an interesting book of it, intelligently
packed with admirable photographs. He still keeps to his
fine theme, the interpretation of Russia and the plea for
friendliness, trust and a large co-operation with her on our
part over the problems of peace and power. Among such
problems he drifts about with a disarming <i>naïvetè</i>, a little
out of depth and more than a little sagacious. An excellent
specimen of the converted "Radical-Imperialist."</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p>There used, I believe, to be an old controversy as to how
many angels could dance on the point of a needle. Somehow,
this antique problem is always brought to my mind by the
short stories of Mr. <span class="sc">Barry Pain</span>, perhaps because he seems
to have the power of marshalling more angels of pity and
fear and laughter in the restricted area of a few printed
pages than almost any other writer. How true this is you
have now a fine opportunity of judging, since the first volume
of his <i>Collected Tales</i> (<span class="sc">Secker</span>) contains a baker's dozen of
samples selected by himself. Of these the most considerable
(in point of length) is "Wilmay," which might
almost be considered a
very short novel. It is
also to my mind the
weakest thing in the
volume; not even Mr.
<span class="sc">Barry Pain</span> can impart
much freshness to the
middle-aged guardian who
remains, till the final
chapter, blind to the
obvious devotion of his
attractive ward. Elsewhere,
by way of compensation,
we have several
little studies of rare
quality: "Ellen Rider,"
exquisite in its restraint
and genuine feeling; "The
Undying Thing," that
small masterpiece of the
unpleasant, and "The
Night of Glory," a savage
and utterly merciless piece
of anti-sentimentalism
with a moral. Mr. <span class="sc">Pain</span> says in his preface that he has
not included any example of his humorous work. Perhaps
he was looking the other way when "Sparkling Burgundy"
added itself to the collection. Anyhow, I am glad it
eluded him, as it is one of the happiest things in a most
attractive volume.</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p>Miss <span class="sc">Marguerite Bryant</span>, the author of <i>Felicity Crofton</i>
(<span class="sc">Heinemann</span>), can thank the gods for two gifts which lift any
novel of hers well above the ruck of fiction. One is a sense
of style (let me beg her not to play careless pranks with it);
the other such a knowledge of men as is vouchsafed to
very few contemporary women-novelists. You will have
to go far and get very tired before you find a more lovable
heroine than <i>Felicity</i>. Even after you have begun to
suspect that the bearing of her own and other people's
burdens had grown to be a hobby with her, you never
lose faith in her delightfully vivid and radiant personality.
The danger of drawing so fascinating a character is that
when she is off the stage one's attention is apt to wander
to the wings; but Miss <span class="sc">Bryant</span>, though she cannot quite
defeat this peril, has hot been overwhelmed by it. With
one exception the minor parts in her story are excellently
handled, and in the end I have to be grateful for more
refreshment than I have gleaned for many a day.</p>

<h3 class="sans">WOMEN IN WAR-TIME.</h3>

<p>Wherever he has wandered of late, Mr. Punch has been struck by the sight of a
new and capable type of
citizen, always in some responsible position and always alert and efficient.</p>

<p>He has found her, in various incarnations, everywhere. If he goes by the railway
she sells him his ticket.
When he passes through the gate she clips his ticket. When he leaves the station
she collects his ticket.</p>

<p>When he goes by Tube she takes him down in the lift and up in it again. If he
boards a tram or an
omnibus it is she, this new citizen, in a trim businesslike uniform, who
collects his fare.</p>

<p>At his club she brings him his lunch. At many a restaurant she handles plates
once sacred to Fritz and Karl.</p>

<p>He has seen her collecting letters from the pillar-boxes and manfully
shouldering the sack.</p>

<p>When he shops she opens his cab door and receives him, and if it is wet she
holds an umbrella over him.</p>

<p>In countless Banks and Offices she does the work of clerks, released for the
army.</p>

<p>Often he sees her driving a motor-car; often a waggon; often a motor-tricycle
delivering goods. In smart
leggings, tunic and cap she runs errands.</p>

<p>On flag-days (and they occur now and then) she collects money in the streets
hour after hour, no matter
how cold or tired she is. At charity matinées (and they, too, have been known to
happen) she extracts vast
sums of money from the audience for programmes and souvenirs. She sits on a
thousand committees connected
with War charities and alleviations.</p>

<p>At the canteens, which never shut, day or night, she serves soldiers with hot
drinks, cheerfully welcoming
them back to old England, or speeding them with equal cheer on their way to the
War. Dressed in khaki, she
meets soldiers home on leave, leading them to comfortable shelters. Never does
she look so masterful as then,
for she marches at their head like a real commander.</p>

<p>In Regent's Park you may see her guiding blind soldiers, and on Hampstead Heath
Mr. Punch has found
her pulling or pushing crippled soldiers in bath-chairs. Elsewhere she reads to
them and writes their letters
for them, thus helping to beguile the long inactive hours.</p>

<p>In the hospital depôts she makes swabs and bandages by the million, quilts
pneumonia jackets, pads the
tops of crutches and sandpapers splints.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page430" id="page430"></a>[pg 430]</span>

<p>She has hardened her soft hands, through all weathers and seasons, in the labour
of farm and field;
grooming horses, tending cattle, guiding the plough, gathering the harvest.</p>

<p>And all over the country she is continually busy making munitions.</p>

<p>As for the myriad nurses in the hospitals here and abroad, who guard the
precarious flame of life and
dress wounds and cheer the sick&mdash;they do nothing new. That has always, been
woman's mission. But
of course there are countless more nurses than there were two years ago, before
the cataclysm.</p>

<p>Wherever he sees one of the new citizens, or whenever he hears fresh stories of
their address and ability,
Mr. Punch is proud and delighted. "It's almost worth having a war," he will say,
"to prove what stuff our
women are made of." But, always the most chivalrous of men, "Not that it wanted
proof," he will add.</p>

<p>And then, the other day, finding several representatives of the new citizenship
resting in their luncheon hour,
Mr. Punch, taking all his courage into his venerable hands, ventured to chat a
little with them (for of course he
would not dare to interrupt them when they were at work), in order to find out
how they would be now filling
their time were there none of these novel and pressing War duties.</p>

<p>But the remarkable thing is that none of them quite knew. They could not
remember. All they were
certain of amid the haze was the very distinct conviction that, whatever it was,
they would not then have been
so happy as they now were.</p>

<p>"Well, my dears," said Mr. Punch, laughing, "never mind about what you might
have been doing. The
important thing is what you are doing, and when I think of that it makes my eyes
glisten, I am so proud of
you. Perhaps now and then in the past I may have been a little chaffing about
some of your foibles, and even
about some of your aspirations; but I never doubted how splendid you were at
heart; I never for a moment
supposed you would be anything but ready and keen when the hour of need struck.
And I was right, bless
your spirited hearts! I was right. For here you are, filling the men's places,
so that they can be the more free
to go and fight for us, and doing it all smilingly and cleverly as though you'd
never done anything else. I
think it's magnificent. I'm an old man and I've seen a great many things in my
time, but I've never seen
anything better or anything that gave me more pleasure."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Mr. Punch," said one of the new citizens&mdash;rather a pretty one,
too&mdash;"you're not really old."</p>

<p>"No! no!" cried the others.
"You're very kind and sweet," said Mr. Punch, "but you're wrong. I am old, very
old&mdash;in fact just
three quarters of a century old; and in proof of that let me hand you my</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
